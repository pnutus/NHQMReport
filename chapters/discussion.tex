This is probably an importent part of the report and even though we present the results in the text I believe it good to have a more thorough discussion at the end where we mention things like:

\begin{itemize}
\item How well our work went.
\item Issues along the long and winding road.
\item Performance stuff.
\item How to proceed.
\item What could we had donde differently.
\item etc.
\end{itemize}
