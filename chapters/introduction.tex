\emph{Quantum mechanics} (QM) is a cornerstone of modern physics, as it describes the world on the smallest of scales.
On this small level we observe a vast number of interesting phenomena, some of which in our ordinary large-scale world seem completely impossible.
One of these phenomena is called \emph{resonance} and is the focus of this report.
%To study these resonances we will expand the hamiltonian in a \emph{Berggren basis}, which makes the hamiltonian non-hermitian, leading us into the world of \emph{Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics} (NHQM).

Resonances, or \emph{quasi-stationary states}, are states in which a nucleon is bound to a nucleus, but only for a limited time. The probability of the nucleon remaining bound will decay exponentially over time. This can be explained as the state having a complex energy by the following argument:

The time-dependency of a stationary state $\psi$ is, by the Shr√∂dinger equation,
\begin{eq}
	\psi(t)
	=e^{-\frac{iE}{\hbar}t}\psi(0).
\end{eq}
With the energy $E$ real, the exponential factor in front is just a phase and the probability $|\psi(t)|^2$ is unchanged over time. However, if we let the energy be complex
\begin{eq}
	E = E_0 - i\frac{\Gamma}{2},
\end{eq}
we get
\begin{eq}
  |\psi(t)|^2 
  =
  \absq{
    e^{-\frac{iE_0}{\hbar} t} e^{- \frac{\Gamma}{2\hbar} t} \psi(0)
  }
  =
  e^{-\frac{\Gamma}{\hbar} t} \absq{\psi(0)},
\end{eq} 
which describes a resonant state with half-life $t_{1/2}=\hbar\ln 2/\Gamma$.


\todo{This paragraph sort of breaks flow}
Resonances can be understood more easily by observing the potential of the nucleus.
The potentials for different nuclei look slightly different, but in all nuclei where resonances is observed we find a potential barrier.
Now combine this with the knowledge of QM and we can explain the previously unexpected behavior with another phenomenon: tunneling.
Tunneling says that when looking at a QM-system with a potential barrier a particle once found on one side of the barrier later has a probability of being found on the other.
This is what happens in the case of quasi-stationary states.

This report will study resonances in the Helium isopes \He{5} and \He{6}.
Helium is chosen since \He{4} is a very stable nucleus and thus can be treated a single (alpha) particle. \He{5} has a known resonance with half-life $t_{1/2} = \SI{700e-24}{s}$. \He{6} is a so-called Boromean nucleus which, because of the interaction between the valence neutrons, has a bound state.

All calculations were made in the Python programming language using the libraries NumPy and SciPy. We used the matplotlib library to make the figures. The code was managed using Git and is available at \url{https://github.com/pnutus/NHQM}.
