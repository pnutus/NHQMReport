In Quantum Mechanics (QM), a particle is often said to be either bound or free.
However, there is a third possibility, where the particle is bound, but
only for a limited time, after which it escapes. This kind of state is 
called a \emph{quasi-bound} state, or a \emph{resonance}. The 
probability of a quasi-bound particle remaining bound will decay 
exponentially over time. This can be explained as the state 
having a complex energy by the following argument:

The time-dependency of a bound, stationary state $\psi$ is
\begin{eq}
	\psi(t)
	= 
  \exp\p{-\frac{iE}{\hbar}t}\psi(0).
\end{eq}
With the energy $E$ real, the exponential factor is just a phase 
and the probability $|\psi(t)|^2$ is unchanged over time (hence the name
stationary). However, if we let the energy be complex
\begin{eq}
	E = E_0 - i\frac{\Gamma}{2},
\end{eq}
we get
\begin{eq}
  |\psi(t)|^2 
  =
  \absq{
    \exp\p{-\frac{iE_0}{\hbar} t} \exp\p{- \frac{\Gamma}{2\hbar} t} \psi(0)
  }
  =
  \exp\p{-\frac{\Gamma}{\hbar} t} \absq{\psi(0)}
\end{eq} 
which describes a resonant state with half-life 
$t_{1/2}=\hbar\ln 2/\Gamma$ and so-called \emph{width} $\Gamma$.

\todo{Is non-hermitian even important?}
It seems, then, that we need complex energies to describe resonant 
states. However, complex eigenvalues pose a problem in standard QM. 
This since observable quantities are regarded as real values 
and are described by \emph{Hermitian} operators. When working with 
complex eigenvalues one needs a \emph{non-Hermitian} formulation of 
the problem, which we encounter in \cref{cha:nhqm}.

The systems we have chosen to study using numerical calculations
are the nuclei of the  Helium isotopes \He{5} and \He{6}. We chose Helium  
because \He{4} has a very stable nucleus that can be treated 
as a single (alpha) particle. \He{5} and \He{6} are then modeled
as an alpha particle core with one or two valence neutrons, 
respectively. 

\He{5} has a known resonance with half-life $t_{1/2} = \SI{700e-24}{s}$,
which we verify. In addition to resonant states, \He{6} has a bound state because of the attraction between the valence neutrons. Our goal is to find these resonances and bound states, to verify the method used.
\todo{Should we have results in the introduction.}

\todo{Tunneling is when $E<V\sub{max}$. This is $E>V\sub{max}$. But we can relate them!}

\todo{Where does width stuff go?}
% Heisenberg's uncertainty principle gives a relation between energy and time
% \begin{equation}
% \Delta E \Delta t \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}.
% \end{equation}
% Hence a state with finite life time must have an uncertainty in its energy spectrum, this is called the \emph{width} of a resonant state. It is this width that is measured in experiments.

The report begins in \cref{cha:basis expansion} by introducing the concept of 
basis expansion, which is the mathematical foundation for all the
following calculations. The basis expansion method is then used in 
\cref{cha:he5} to study the \He{5} nucleus, looking for a resonance.
\Cref{cha:nhqm} introduces the Berggren basis, which
allows the resonance to be quantified.

\Cref{cha:many-body} is an introduction to many-body theory, focusing 
on fermionic systems. The many-body theory is then used in \cref{cha:he6} 
to study the \He{6} nucleus, a three-body problem. \Cref{cha:he7}
continues with the four-body \He{7} nucleus, and in \cref{cha:monte carlo}
a Monte Carlo method is used to speed up calculations.
