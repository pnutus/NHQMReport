\chapter{Introduction}

The properties of a quantum mechanical system are determined by its Hamiltonian. 
Particles in a potential well with infinitely high walls form localized bound states.
Such a system is called a \emph{closed quantum system}, since the number of particles is conserved and the particles are localized in a finite region. 
The energy of a closed quantum system can only take on discrete values, as illustrated in \cref{fig:closed_quantum_system} with the harmonic oscillator potential.

An \emph{open quantum system}, on the other hand, portrayed in \cref{fig:open_quantum_system}, is a system with a finite potential.
For a system with a vanishing potential particles can enter and exit the system and, consequently, there are unbound states. 
For a trivial potential these are just free particle states but for a non-negligible potential these are denoted \emph{scattering states}.
Depending on the depth of the potential well of the open system, there can be a finite number of bound states.

In addition to the bound and unbound states, some open quantum systems harbor \emph{resonances}. 
These are \emph{quasi-bound} states that are neither bound nor unbound, but exhibit properties of both. 

They appear in the continuum, like unbound states, but are localized, like bound states.
However, the wavefunction of a resonance is only localized for a finite amount of time, as opposed to a bound, \emph{stationary} state that forever stays the same.
A resonance can be described with a complex energy, as the following argument suggests.

The state of a particle is described by its wavefunction $\psi$, which can be written as the product of a function of time and position
\begin{eq}
  \psi(t, \vec{r}) = \psi_t(t)\psi_{\vec{r}}(\vec{r}).
\end{eq}
The wavefunction evolves according to the \emph{Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation} (TDSE)
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:schrödinger}
  i\hbar\ddt\ket\psi = H \ket\psi.
\end{eq}
An eigenstate of the Hamiltonian $H$ with energy $E$, i.e. a solution to the \emph{Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation} (TISE)
\begin{eq}
  H \ket\psi = E \ket\psi
\end{eq}
has the simple time evolution
\begin{eq}
	\psi(t, \vec{r})
	= 
  \exp\p{-\frac{iE}{\hbar}t}\psi_t(0)\psi_{\vec{r}}(\vec{r}).
\end{eq}
With the energy $E$ real, the exponential factor is just a phase 
and the probability $|\psi(t, \vec{r})|^2$ of finding the particle at a given $\vec{r}$ is unchanged over time. 
However, if we let the energy be complex
\begin{eq}
	E = E_0 - i\frac{\Gamma}{2},
\end{eq}
we get
\begin{eq}
  |\psi(t, \vec{r})|^2 
  =
  \absq{
    \exp\p{-\frac{iE_0}{\hbar} t} 
    \exp\p{- \frac{\Gamma}{2\hbar} t} 
    \psi(0, \vec{r})
  }
  =
  \exp\p{-\frac{\Gamma}{\hbar} t} \absq{\psi(0, \vec{r})}
\end{eq} 
describing a resonance state decaying exponentially with half-life $t_{1/2}=\hbar\ln 2/\Gamma$. This parameter $\Gamma$ is called the \emph{width} of the resonance.

\todo{width/scattering argument?}

We want to use the simpler formalism of the TISE, as opposed to the more general TDSE, and we see that this is possible by letting the resonance have a complex energy.
However, complex eigenvalues pose a problem in standard quantum mechanics, where operators are postulated to be Hermitian.
Hermitian operators can only have real eigenvalues, and are thus insufficient for treating resonances.

\todo{aim?}
The aim of this thesis is to present methods for describing resonances using the TISE in a complex-energy framework. 
To demonstrate the methods, we will study the simple nuclear systems \He{5} and \He{6}.
They are relevant because the ground state of \He{5} and the first excited state of both \He{5} and \He{6} are resonances. 
Despite the unbound nature of \He{5}, the ground state of \He{6} is actually bound, an example of a \emph{Borromean} system, named after the Borromean rings depicted on the cover of this thesis.

The thesis can conceptually be divided into two parts, the first covering resonances in a simple two-body problem and the second part covering the first steps toward more complicated many-body systems. 
In \cref{cha:basis_expansion} the \emph{basis expansion} method for solving the Schrödinger equation is introduced.
The basis expansion method is then used in \cref{cha:two-body} to study a loosely bound two-body nuclear system, the \He{5} nucleus.
In \Cref{cha:berggren} we use the Berggren basis to reproduce the resonance in \He{5}.

\Cref{cha:many-body} is an introduction to many-body theory, focusing on fermionic systems. 
The many-body theory is then utilized in \cref{cha:three-body} 
to study a three-body problem, specifically the \He{6} nucleus.  
Finally, \cref{cha:outlook} is an outlook discussing further development of the methods.
