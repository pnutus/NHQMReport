We view the \He{5} nucleus as an alpha particle (\He{4}) interacting with a valence neutron.
Since the exact nucleon-nucleon interaction is unknown, we use the established
Woods-Saxon potential as an approximation. The Woods-Saxon potential (\cref{fig:woods-saxons}) is given by
\todo{What's the 4 for?}
\todo{From where do we get our $V_0$ and $V\sub{so}$?}
\begin{eq}
	V(r)=
	V_0f(r) - 4V\sub{so}\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\frac{1}{r}\frac{df}{dr}
\end{eq}
where 
\begin{eq}
	f(r)=\frac{1}{1+\exp\p{\frac{r-r_0}{d}}}.
\end{eq}
We use the depth $V_0 = \SI{-47}{MeV}$, spin-orbit coupling strength $V\sub{so} = \SI{-7.5}{Mev}$, range $r_0 = \SI{2}{fm}$ and diffuseness $d = \SI{0.65}{fm}$.
The spin-orbit coupling can be either attractive or repulsive depending on how the angular momenta couples
\begin{eq}
  \vec{l}\cdot\vec{s} 
  = 
  \frac{1}{2}
  \bigp{
    j(j+1)-l(l+1)-s(s+1)
  }
  =
  \begin{cases}
    l,    &\text{ if } j = l + \frac{1}{2}\\
    -l-1, &\text{ if } j = l - \frac{1}{2}\\
  \end{cases}
  .
\end{eq}

Since we approximate the system as a spherically symmetric interaction 
between two particles, we can reduce the problem to a one-dimensional equation by using the relative coordinate $r = r_\alpha - r_n$ and introducing the reduced mass
\begin{eq}
  \mu = \frac{m_\alpha m_n}{m_\alpha + m_n} \approx .
\end{eq}

\section{Convergence}
\todo{Is convergence even important?}
We can solve the problem using either HO expansion or discretizised momentum space. A comparison of convergence is shown in \cref{fig:HO vs mom}.
\todo{Skip zoom and title of plot.}

\section{Wavefunctions}

\Cref{fig:resonance wavefunction} compares the radial probability distributions $r^2|R(r)^2|$ for two states as the potential is varied. We see that one solution is basically unchanged under variation of the potential. This can be interpreted as it being an unbound state in the energy continuum. We see that its probability distribution does not decrease for large $r$.

The other state has an energy $E>0$ meaning that it, too, must be unbound. However, its wavefunction is highly localized near the center, suggesting a quasi-stationary state. Additionally, the solution varies dramatically with the potential, meaning that it must be a feature of the system. 

\todo{Remove last however.}However, because we are working within the realm of real numbers, we can gain no further insight into the nature of these solutions yet, since we expect the resonance to be properly described only by complex energies.

\todo{Start with a deeper well holding a bound state, and then decrease it to get resonances? Add another subplot?}
