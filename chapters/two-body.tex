\chapter{The Two-Body Nuclear System}
\label{cha:two-body}

In this chapter we investigate a simple two-body nuclear system using the basis expansion methods from the previous chapter.
We begin by discussing the shell model, the Woods-Saxon potential and our model system, \He{5}.
The Schrödinger equation is then solved in the HO and momentum bases.
The solutions are studied by looking at the energies and wavefunctions while varying parameters, aiming to identify a resonance.

\section{The Nuclear Shell Model}
A typical example of an open quantum system is the atomic nucleus encountered in nuclear physics. 
The atomic nucleus is held together by the short-ranged strong interaction acting between all nucleons and is commonly studied within a shell model.
This is done by introducing a \emph{mean-field} potential, often by the following procedure \cite{suhonen}:

Consider the Hamiltonian for a system of $A$ interacting particles,
\begin{eq}
  H = \sum_{i=1}^A \frac{1}{2m_i} \nabla_i^2 
  + 
  \sum_{j<i=1}^A v(\vec{r}_i,\vec{k}_i, \vec{r}_j, \vec{k}_j)
\end{eq}
where $v$ is the nucleon-nucleon interaction. Now add and subtract a potential field $V(\vec{r})$ affecting all particles,
\begin{eq}
  H &= \sum_i \b{ 
    \frac{1}{2m_i} \nabla_i^2 + V(\vec{r}_i) 
    }
  + 
  \sum_{j<i} \b{ 
    v(\vec{r}_i,\vec{k}_i, \vec{r}_j, \vec{k}_j) - V(\vec{r_i})
  } \\
  &=
  H_1 + V\sub{res}
\end{eq} 
where we have split the Hamiltonian into a spherically symmetric mean-field Hamiltonian $H_1$ in which particles do not interact directly, and the \emph{residual interaction} $V\sub{res}$ which can be seen as the new interaction between particles. 
If the mean-field potential $V$ is chosen carefully, $V\sub{res}$ can become small enough to be treated pertubationally (if at all). 

 
\subsection{The Woods-Saxon Potential}
The mean-field potential we use is the Woods-Saxon potential with spin-orbit coupling, a standard potential used in nuclear shell models \cite{suhonen}. The potential is visualized in \cref{fig:woods-saxons} and is given by
\begin{eq}
	V(r)=
	-V_0f(r) - 4V\sub{so}\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\frac{1}{r}\frac{df}{dr},
\end{eq}
where 
\begin{eq}
	f(r)=\b{1+\exp\p{\frac{r-r_0}{d}}}^{-1}.
\end{eq}
The parameters are the potential depth $V_0$, the spin-orbit coupling strength $V\sub{so}$, the range $r_0$ and the diffuseness $d$. 
There are approximate formulas for these values, depending on the number of each kind of nucleon. 
Alternatively, one can fit the parameters to reproduce experimental energy levels.
We will use both approaches.

Note that the spin-orbit coupling term can give either attractive or repulsive contributions, depending on how the angular momenta couples. Recall that
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:spin-orbit}
  \vec{l}\cdot\vec{s} 
  = 
  \frac{\hbar^2}{2}
  \bigp{
    j(j+1)-l(l+1)-s(s+1)
  }
  =
  \frac{\hbar^2}{2}
  \begin{cases}
    l,    &\text{ if } j = l + \frac{1}{2}\\
    -l-1, &\text{ if } j = l - \frac{1}{2}\\
  \end{cases}
  ,
\end{eq}
where we have stated the result in the case of one valence nucleon.

\subsection{Magic Nuclei}

The shell model has had some success in reproducing the general features of nuclides \cite{suhonen}, especially for lighter nuclei ($A<50$). 
It is found that there are magic numbers of nucleons, where the protons or neutrons form complete shells with $0$ total angular momentum. 
Of special interest to us are \emph{doubly magic} nuclei, where both proton and neutron numbers are magic. 
These nuclei can be very tightly bound, and will therefore interact weakly with nucleons in outer shells.
If we add nucleons to a doubly magic nuclei, we can thus treat it as a rigid \emph{core}, interacting with valence neutrons through the mean-field only.

We will consider the special case of core and one valence neutron, seen as two particles interacting with a spherically symmetric potential. 
We can then perform the standard procedure of reducing the problem to a one-dimensional equation by using the relative coordinate 
$r = |\vec{r}_\alpha - \vec{r}_n|$ and the reduced mass
\begin{eq}
  \mu = \frac{m_\alpha m_n}{m_\alpha + m_n}.
\end{eq}

\section{The \He{5} Nucleus}
We choose to study \He{5}, seen as a \He{4} nucleus and a valence neutron. 
The \He{4} nucleus ($\alpha$ particle) is doubly magic, with two $s_{1/2}$-neutrons and two $s_{1/2}$-protons forming full shells, creating a stable core.  

Because the $s$-shell is already filled in \He{4}, the valence neutron of \He{5} will be a $p$-wave, with $l=1$. 
We see in \cref{eq:spin-orbit} that the $p_{3/2}$-wave will get a negative net contribution from the total spin-orbit term, also shown in \cref{fig:woods-saxons}.
This means that the ground state of \He{5} will be the $p_{3/2}$-wave, with $p_{1/2}$ an excited state.
Both the $p_{3/2}$- and $p_{1/2}$-waves have known resonance states.

We use the procedures described in \cref{cha:basis_expansion} to numerically solve the \He{5} Schrödinger equation for the $p_{3/2}$-wave. When examining the solutions, we are specifically looking for the ground state resonance.

The Woods-Saxon parameters will initially be set to standard values to investigate the general behavior of the solutions. The following values are used \cite{gamow_shell_model_2008}: 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r l}
 Potential depth               & $V_0 = \SI{47}{MeV}$   \\
 Spin-orbit coupling strength  & $V\sub{so} = \SI{-7.5}{Mev}$ \\
 Range                         & $r_0 = \SI{2}{fm}   $  \\
 Diffuseness                   & $d = \SI{0.65}{fm}$  \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We later optimize the parameters to match experimentally determined energy levels for \He{5}.

\subsection{Harmonic Oscillator Basis}

We begin by solving the \He{5} Schrödinger equation in the HO basis. 
The solutions are shown in \cref{fig:energies(r0)} as a function of the range $r_0$ of the HO potential.
All solutions have energies $E > 0$, meaning that they are unbound states, and thus have unlimited range and are not localized.
However, we see a saddle point in energy for the lowest energy solution when the HO range $r_0 \approx \SI{1}{fm}$, corresponding to radii within the nucleus.
The range $r_0$ is a measure of the range of the HO eigenfunctions and the saddle behavior is a sign of a localized wavefunction in that vicinity.
However, the change in behavior is small, and we cannot draw any conclusions from it.

\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% E(r0) end


Because the harmonic oscillator consists only of bound states and we are trying to study unbound states, this method cannot take us much further.
We will have to switch to a basis with wavefunctions of infinite range to properly describe this system.

\subsection{Momentum Basis}
\label{sub:momentum_basis}

The momentum basis describes a plane wave, i.e. a free particle, with wave functions of infinite range.
Because all \He{5} solutions appear in the continuum, this basis is better suited for the problem than the HO basis.

\subsubsection{Momementum Wavefunctions}

Solving the Schrödinger equation in the momentum basis gives us momentum eigenfunctions $\phi(k)$, presented in \cref{fig:real_momentum_wavefunctions}.
There is a background of wavefunctions peaking at different values of $k$, and one wavefunction standing out as lower and wider.
This is the same state that showed some odd behavior in the HO-basis, but let us first discuss the peak-shaped wavefunctions.

  	\includegraphics[page=1]{../figures/eigvecs_real/eigvecs.pdf}
  \caption{\He{5} radial-momentum probability distributions. There is one solution that stands out as wider than the surrounding states. We can also see a trend toward lower and wider states around $k = \SI{1}{fm^{-1}}$, but it has no physical significance. 
  Instead, it is a consequence of the discretized, truncated basis that gives us a finite number of continuum states, one of which is ``stolen'' by the unique state.
  This means that is impossible for each discretized momentum to correspond to a solution of well-defined $k$, resulting in lower and wider peaks.
  }
  \label{fig:real_momentum_wavefunctions}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%WF real/complex end

Recall the relation \cref{eq:radial wavefunction} between wavefunctions in position and momentum representation
\begin{eq}
  R(r)=i^l\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \fint[0][\inf]{k} k^2 \phi(k)j_l(kr).
\end{eq} 
A wavefunction peaking at a single value $k_i$ corresponds to a radial wavefunction
\begin{eq}
  R_i(r) = i^l\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} j_l(k_i r).
\end{eq}
The spherical Bessel functions $j_l(k_i r)$ are eigensolutions to the Schrödinger equation for free particles with spherical symmetry. 
We can thus conclude that the peak-shaped solutions correspond to free particles. 
This is not unexpected as we are dealing with an open quantum system that only marginally perturbs passing particles, explaining why we find unbound solutions corresponding to each value of $k$ used in the discretized basis.

The unique state peaks at $k = \SI{0.17}{fm^{-1}}$ and is  wider than the surrounding states. 
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that a less well-defined momentum corresponds to a more well-defined position.
Consequently, this state should correspond to a localized wavefunction, which is what we expect from a resonance.
The unique state is the same as the one obtained using the HO basis, sugges\todo[inline]{här är bortfall}

\subsubsection{Position Space Wavefunctions}

To investigate the relation between the hypothesized resonance solution and a bound solution, we increase the depth of the potential to $V_0 = \SI{70}{MeV}$, and successively decrease the depth until there is no bound state. 
This is documented in \cref{fig:wavefunctions}, where the radial probability distributions $r^2|R(r)^2|$ are plotted for the widest momentum wavefunction together with an arbitrary unbound state. 
With a deep potential, the bound state wavefunction quickly tends to zero outside the potential well.
As we decrease the depth below a certain threshold, the potential well no longer supports a bound state ($E > 0$), but there remains a localized wavefunction.
At \SI{47}{MeV}, which roughly corresponds to \He{5}, we can still identify a unique state and it is, in fact, the same state as the one standing out in
\cref{fig:real_momentum_wavefunctions}.
If we decrease the depth further, the unique state becomes less and less distinguishable from the others.
