We want to study the nuclei of Helium isotopes by solving the time independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation (TISE)
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:TISE}
  H \ket\psi = E \ket\psi.
\end{eq}
The TISE is commonly written in the position basis as
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:TISEpos}
  \p{-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\vec{r})}\psi(\vec{r}) = E\psi(\vec{r}),
\end{eq}
since this is the only basis where the potential operator $V$ is known.

For the nuclear systems we are looking at, the TISE has no known analytical solutions, and we need to use numerical methods to solve it. However, written as in \cref{eq:TISEpos}, it is not suitable for numerical calculations. Instead, we would  like to write it as a matrix equation
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:matrix equation}
  \sum_j H_{ij}\psi_j = E \psi_i
\end{eq}
with a finite matrix $H$ that we can diagonalize to find the eigenvalues $E$.

To write the TISE as a matrix equation we use \emph{basis expansion}. Basis expansion is how we make any sense at all of the abstract Hilbert spaces, operators and state vectors of QM. By expanding these abstract objects in a basis, we can relate them to the physical world. For example, equation \cref{eq:TISEpos} is the TISE for a particle, expanded in the position basis. This is the only basis in which we can express the potential, why we will always have to relate our new bases to this one.

Before we begin, we briefly recap some well known QM facts. First we need a \emph{complete basis}, either discrete $\ket{n}$ or continuous $\ket{x}$. A discrete basis means that any state $\ket\psi$ can be written as a linear combination of the basis states
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:lincomb}	
  \ket\psi = \sum_n \psi_n \ket{n}
  \quad
  \textup{or}
  \quad
  \ket\psi = \fint{x} \psi(x) \ket{x}.
\end{eq}
The complete bases we will use in this report are the \emph{position basis} $\ket{\vec{r}}$, the \emph{momentum basis} $\ket{\vec{k}}$, the \emph{harmonic oscillator basis} $\ket{nlm}$ and the elusive \emph{Berggren basis} \cite{berggren}. All these bases are orthonormal, i.e. all the basis vectors satisfy 
\begin{eq}
  \braket{n}{n'} = \delta_{nn'}
  \quad
  \textup{or}
  \quad
  \braket{x}{x'} = \delta(x - x').
\end{eq}
With a complete basis $\ket{n}$, we get the very useful \emph{completeness relation}
\begin{eq}
  I = \sum_n \ket{n} \bra{n}
  \quad
  \textup{or}
  \quad
  I = \fint{x} \ket{x}\bra{x},
\end{eq}
where $I$ is the identity operator. This relation can therefore be inserted anywhere in any equation, and will find frequent use in this report. 

Let's now expand the TISE in the abstract $\ket{n}$ basis. We start by inserting the completeness relation for $\ket{n}$ in \cref{eq:TISE}
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:expand1}
  H
  \p{
    \sum_{n'} \ket{n'} \bra{n'}
  }
  \ket\psi
  =
  \sum_{n'} H \ket{n'} \braket{n'}{\psi}
  =
  E \ket\psi.
\end{eq}
By closing \cref{eq:lincomb} with $\bra{n}$ on the left side and using orthonormality, we see that $\braket{n'}{\psi} = \psi_{n'}$. Now we close \cref{eq:expand1} with $\bra{n}$ on the left
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:expand2}
  \sum_{n'} \bra{n} H \ket{n'} \psi_{n'}
  = 
  E \braket{n}{\psi},
\end{eq}
and if we write $H_{nn'} = \bra{n} H \ket{n'}$, we get
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:expand3}
  \sum_{n'} H_{nn'} \psi_{n'} = E \psi_n,
\end{eq}
which is equivalent to the matrix \cref{eq:matrix equation}. This is the basic method of expanding the TISE in a basis. Expanding in an abstract basis won't get us very far, however, so we move on to the epitomic example: the harmonic oscillator.

\todo{Where is the theory for \He{5} potential? We should mention Woods-Saxon.}
A comparison of performance between HO and momentum basis expansion for the hydrogen atom and \He{5} problems is shown in \cref{fig:HO vs mom}.

\end{figure}

Let us study the obtained solutions closer. If we transform the momentum wavefunctions $\phi(k)$ to radial position wavefunctions $R(r)$ according to \cref{sec:radial_mom_space_TISE},
\todo{Maybe wavefunctions are bit too technical for this section. Move to numerical section?}
\begin{eq}
R(r)=i^l\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \int_0^\infty \rd k \, k^2 \phi(k)j_l(kr) \, ,
\end{eq} 
we can see the spatial distribution of our solutions. In our discretized basis this would be written
\begin{eq}
R(r)=i^l\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\sum_{j=1}^N \sqrt{w_j}k_j\phi_j'j_l(k_j r) \, .
\end{eq}
\Cref{fig:momspace solutions} shows the wavefunctions $R(r)$ for a few of the states with lowest energy.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{mom_solutions.pdf}
  \caption{A few solutions to the Woods-Saxon potential with well depth $V0=\SI{-52}{MeV}$. The probability distributions $r^2|R(r)|^2$ are plotted relative to their energies. }
  \label{fig:momspace solutions}
\end{figure}

 While all of the states we see have energies $E>0$, and thus are unbound, we see that one solution is more localized near the center $r=0$. This is the sign of a quasi-bound state. To confirm this we may vary the depth $V0$ of the potential well and see how this affects the solutions. \Cref{fig:momspace solutions var} shows the solutions obtained with a different $V0$.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{mom_solutions_var.pdf}
  \caption{A few solutions for $V0=\SI{-47}{MeV}$.}
  \label{fig:momspace solutions var}
  \todo{This fig could be combined with previous}
\end {figure}
We see that the unbound states remain practically unchanged. This means that they basically correspond to free particles of energies $E_n=\frac{k_n^2}{2\mu}$, where $k_n$ are the momenta that were included in the discretization of the integrals. We will refer to these values of $k$ as our \emph{mesh points}. The quasi-bound state changed dramatically, which shows that this solution is a feature of the system we are studying.
