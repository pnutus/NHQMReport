We want to study the nuclei of Helium isotopes by solving the time independent Schr√∂dinger equation (TISE)
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:TISE}
  H \ket\psi = E \ket\psi.
\end{eq}
The TISE is commonly written in the position basis as
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:TISEpos}
  \p{-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\vec{r})}\psi(\vec{r}) = E\psi(\vec{r}),
\end{eq}
since this is the only basis where the potential operator $V$ is known.

For the nuclear systems we are looking at, the TISE has no known analytical solutions, and we need to use numerical methods to solve it. However, written as in \cref{eq:TISEpos}, it is not suitable for numerical calculations. Instead, we would  like to write it as a matrix equation
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:matrix equation}
  \sum_j H_{ij}\psi_j = E \psi_i
\end{eq}
with a finite matrix $H$ that we can diagonalize to find the eigenvalues $E$.

To write the TISE as a matrix equation we use \emph{basis expansion}. Basis expansion is how we make any sense at all of the abstract Hilbert spaces, operators and state vectors of QM. By expanding these abstract objects in a basis, we can relate them to the physical world. For example, equation \cref{eq:TISEpos} is the TISE for a particle, expanded in the position basis. This is the only basis in which we can express the potential, why we will always have to relate our new bases to this one.

Before we begin, we briefly recap some well known QM facts. First we need a \emph{complete basis}, either discrete $\ket{n}$ or continuous $\ket{x}$. A discrete basis means that any state $\ket\psi$ can be written as a linear combination of the basis states
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:lincomb}	
  \ket\psi = \sum_n \psi_n \ket{n}
  \quad
  \textup{or}
  \quad
  \ket\psi = \fint{x} \psi(x) \ket{x}.
\end{eq}
The complete bases we will use in this report are the \emph{position basis} $\ket{\vec{r}}$, the \emph{momentum basis} $\ket{\vec{k}}$, the \emph{harmonic oscillator basis} $\ket{nlm}$ and the elusive \emph{Berggren basis} \cite{berggren}. All these bases are orthonormal, i.e. all the basis vectors satisfy 
\begin{eq}
  \braket{n}{n'} = \delta_{nn'}
  \quad
  \textup{or}
  \quad
  \braket{x}{x'} = \delta(x - x').
\end{eq}
With a complete basis $\ket{n}$, we get the very useful \emph{completeness relation}
\begin{eq}
  I = \sum_n \ket{n} \bra{n}
  \quad
  \textup{or}
  \quad
  I = \fint{x} \ket{x}\bra{x},
\end{eq}
where $I$ is the identity operator. This relation can therefore be inserted anywhere in any equation, and will find frequent use in this report. 

Let's now expand the TISE in the abstract $\ket{n}$ basis. We start by inserting the completeness relation for $\ket{n}$ in \cref{eq:TISE}
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:expand1}
  H
  \p{
    \sum_{n'} \ket{n'} \bra{n'}
  }
  \ket\psi
  =
  \sum_{n'} H \ket{n'} \braket{n'}{\psi}
  =
  E \ket\psi.
\end{eq}
By closing \cref{eq:lincomb} with $\bra{n}$ on the left side and using orthonormality, we see that $\braket{n'}{\psi} = \psi_{n'}$. Now we close \cref{eq:expand1} with $\bra{n}$ on the left
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:expand2}
  \sum_{n'} \bra{n} H \ket{n'} \psi_{n'}
  = 
  E \braket{n}{\psi},
\end{eq}
and if we write $H_{nn'} = \bra{n} H \ket{n'}$, we get
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:expand3}
  \sum_{n'} H_{nn'} \psi_{n'} = E \psi_n,
\end{eq}
which is equivalent to the matrix \cref{eq:matrix equation}. This is the basic method of expanding the TISE in a basis. Expanding in an abstract basis won't get us very far, however, so we move on to the epitomic example: the harmonic oscillator.

\section{The Hydrogen Atom} 

To test our HO and plane-wave bases, we expand the well known and analytically solvable hydrogen atom.
We compare the results in \cref{fig:ho_mom}.
Here we have the unit \emph{Hartree} for energy, which makes the sought value \unit{0.5}{H}.
We see that the plane-wave expansion converges faster than the harmonic oscillator, but towards the wrong value.
This is because the momentum space expansion not support the use of non-finite potentials and since the coulomb potentioal of the hydrogen atom is propotional to$\frac{1}{r}$, a small deviation is not unexpected.\todo{is expected or as it is?}
