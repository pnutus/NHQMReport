\chapter{The Complex Momentum Basis}
\label{cha:berggren}

\todo{momentum/plane wave???}
In \cref{cha:two-body} we studied the \He{5} system and found a special state in the continuum which we believe to be a resonance. 
We will in this chapter detail a method of extending the momentum basis to the complex plane, which gives a more complete description of resonances. 
The \He{5} problem is then examined once more using this new tool.

\section{The Complex Momentum Plane} 

\todo{Mention scattering theory?}
We argued in the introduction that resonances can only be properly described by a complex energy
\begin{eq}
  E=E_0-i\frac{\Gamma}{2}.
\end{eq}
We may relate the energy of a system to a momentum $k$, according to
\begin{eq}
  E = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2\mu}
  \quad\quad
  \textup{or}
  \quad\quad
  k = \frac{\sqrt{2\mu E}}{\hbar},
\end{eq}
\todo{this tells us???}
This tells us that the resonant states have complex momenta and that we have to extend the plane wave basis into the complex momentum plane in order to find them.
To clarify what this means, consider again the Schrödinger equation in momentum representation, \cref{eq:radial mom space TISE}:
\begin{eq}
  \frac{k^2}{2\mu}\phi(k) + \fint[0][\inf]{k'} k'^2 V(k,k') \phi(k') 
  &=
  E\phi(k).
\end{eq}
Using a complex momentum basis effectively means that we evaluate the integral not along the real line,  
In 1968, Berggren \cite{berggren} first showed that the solutions---bound states, resonant states and the non-resonant continuum---that are obtained using this scheme form a complete orthonormal basis. 
\todo[inline]{where is the complete basis equation?}

This is a major result, meaning that resonances are included as proper solutions to open quantum systems. This will be of importance later, when we consider systems of multiple interacting particles. 
In this Chapter, we will instead focus on using contours in the complex momentum plane to find the resonances of \He{5}.

To find the resonance with its complex energy as a solution, it is required that a contour is chosen such that it passes below the momentum corresponding to the resonance. 
This follows from Cauchy's residue theorem, and the fact that the resonance corresponds to a pole in the complex plane
\footnote{See standard quantum mechanics textbooks on scattering theory for more detail, e.g. \cite{sakurai}}.
A sample contour that could be used is visualized in \cref{fig:berggren contour}.
Note that the solutions are mirrored in the imaginary axis. It can be shown that this symmetry allows us to restrict our attention to the segment between $0$ and $+\infty$.\cite{berggren}

A curious, but important, fact that follows from this procedure is that the standard scalar product (and thus the norm)
\begin{eq}
  \braket{\phi}{\phi'} = \fint[0][\inf]{k} k^2 \conj{\phi(k)}\phi'(k)
\end{eq}
is replaced with
\begin{eq}
  \braket{\phi}{\phi'} = \fint[0][\inf]{k} k^2 \phi(k)\phi'(k)
\end{eq} 
without the conjugation.

\section{The Complex Contour}
We choose to extend our integration along the real axis to 
the simplest possible complex contour, a triangle-shaped downward extrusion. 
The tip of the triangle is placed below the hypothesized resonance.

We are faced with the problem of evaluating this contour integral numerically. 
We can solve this by considering each straight segment of the contour separately,
and write it as a sum of three integrals, each treated with Gauss-Legendre quadrature according to \cref{app:gauss-legendre}.
An example of a contour is seen in \cref{fig:triangle_contour}, marking each quadrature point where the integrand is evaluated. Note the concentration of points near the ends of each segment, resulting from the Gauss-Legendre quadrature (see \cite{gausslegendre}).

With this procedure, we once again get the Schrödinger equation on the same discretized form as \cref{eq:plane_wave_matrix_elements}:
\begin{eq}
  \label{eq:nhqm matrix element}
  H_{ij}' = \frac{k_i^2}{2\mu}\delta_{ij} + \sqrt{w_i w_j}k_i k_j V_{ij},
\end{eq}
but now with complex $k$ and $w$.

\section{Studying the Resonance}
Armed with this we can continue our study of the \He{5} system. 
Diagonalizing the matrix given by \cref{eq:nhqm matrix element} using a complex contour with vertices $k_0 = 0$, $k_1 = 0.2 - i0.1$, $k_2 = 2.5$ 
with 5 points on each segment, yields the result shown in \cref{fig:verification}.
\todo{tydligare vertices?}
The same Woods-Saxon parameters have been used as before, and we represent the solutions by their momenta, $k=\sqrt{2\mu E}$, corresponding to the eigenvalues. 
We can see that we obtain solutions almost corresponding to the $k$-values used in the discretization, similar to what was found in the real case. 
These are once again interpreted as unbound solutions, not interacting strongly with the potential. 

However, the interesting solution is the one not lying on the contour. If this solution is the resonance, we expect it to be unchanged when the contour is varied. 
Indeed, any contour passing below the resonance should give this solution, with reservation for numerical error. \todo[inline]{cite berggren?}
Solutions from various contours are shown in \cref{fig:pole(cont)}, demonstrating that this is the case.

In addition we can investigate the wavefunctions of these solutions. 
\Cref{fig:mom wavefunctions}\todo{ref ref} shows the momentum distribution of an arbitrary unbound solution and the resonance. We also show the corresponding situation when using the real basis, for comparison. Note how the resonance wavefunction is much more distinguished in the complex basis.  
The unbound solution still correspond to one definite (now complex) momentum. 
On the other hand, the resonance has a broad distribution, reflecting the localized nature of the solution 
(remember Heisenberg --- a broad momentum wavefunction allows a localized position wavefunction). 
In principle, this feature also gives us a way to automatically find the resonance among a large set of solutions: 
simply single out the one with the broadest wavefunction, or equivalently after normalization, with the lowest maximum value.

We can now properly investigate how the solutions change as the potential is varied. \Cref{fig:pole(V0)} shows how the solutions vary as $V_0$ 
is successively changed from \SI{70}{MeV}, where the potential well can contain a bound state, to \SI{50}{MeV}, where no bound states exist. 
As the potential well grows less attractive, we see that the imaginary part $\Gamma$ of the resonance energy increases, and thus the half-time of the quasi-bound state becomes shorter.  

We may now proceed to fit our model of \He{5} to experimental data of the $p_{3/2}$ and  $p_{1/2}$ resonance provided by \cite{inte_jimmy}, giving values 
\todo{fix citation}
\todo{Make tables? One table \cancel{showing} \emph{to rule} them all?}
$p_{3/2}: E_0 = bla bla, \Gamma = bla bla$

$p_{1/2}: E_0 = bla bla, \Gamma = bla bla$ 

Fitting the parameters $V_0$ and $V\sub{so}$ to these four data points give a best fit when

$V_0 = bla$

$V\sub{so} = bla$

where we get the computed values $bla bla$ for the $p_{3/2}$ resonance and $bla bla$ for the $p_{1/2}$ resonance.
