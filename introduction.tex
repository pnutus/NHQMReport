
this is the introduction. There will be more interesting text here later. Hopefully it has started to be later now.

\section{Background}
Quantum mechanics (QM) is a cornerstone of modern physics, as it describes the world on the smallest of scales.
One topic often introduced in graduate QM courses is resonance scattering, a phenomenon where a system form so-called \emph{quasi-stationary} states.
In contrast to \emph{stationary} (bound) states, in which a system remains indefinitely, these quasi-stationary states decay over time.
Describing this process leads naturally to the introduction of complex energy eigenvalues. 

Complex eigenvalues pose a problem in standard QM.
This since observable quantities are regarded as real values and are described by \emph{Hermitian} operators.
When working with complex eigenvalues one thus needs a \emph{non-Hermitian} formulation of the problem.
While the idea of using non-Hermitian quantum mechanics (NHQM) has been around for quite some time, the technique is not widely used.

\section{Resonances}
Resonances is a phenomenon with its origins in scattering theory.
When phycisists scattered neutrons against various nuclei and observed the obtained particles they found that some neutrons seemed to dissappear for a while,
 only to be seen again shortly after.
This was a mystery until (Name of smart scientist, year smart happened) came with an explanation to this problem. (Might not have been a mystery, but the smart phycisist was probably Fermi.)
This explanation introduced so called quasi-bound states, states that behaved as a bound state for a while, but then decayed into smaller pieces.
These quasi-bound states is often reffered to as resonances, even though some phycisists consider resonances only as a peak in scattering cross-section.
They can be understood more easily by observing the potential of the nucleus.
The potentials look slightly different, but in all nuclei where resonances is observed we find a potential barrier.
With the knowledge of QM we can now explain the previously unexpected behavior with another phenomenon: tunneling.
Tunneling says that when looking at a QM-system with a potential barrier a particle once found on one side of the barrier later has a probability of being found on the other.
This is exactly what happens in the case of quasi-bound states.
With some statistics one can now see that these particles have a mean life-time similar to that of radioactive deccay.
This is not a coincidence since they as well are quasi-bound states.

The connection between resonances and NHQM comes from the fact that the barrier width and the mean life-time of the system depends directly on the complex binding momentum,
which is obtained when formulating and solving Schroedingers Equation in a non-hermitian way.


\section{NHQM}
While the problem of standard, Hermition QM, is widely known among phisicists, the NHQM way of thinking lacks an easy-to-process theoretical foundation.
In this report we describe how we addressed this issue by calculating the (complex) eigenvalues of some Helium nuclei.
Helium is choosen since it is has a small nucleus whith several interesting isotopes showing different behavior.
Another nucleus which often is choosen is Lithium, which displays similar behavior.
