A more natural framework to work in for the systems we are studying is that of momentum space. This is done by expanding the Schrödinger equation in momentum basis, demonstrated below. 

SPECULATION:

The reason that we want to solve the problem in momentum space is that we are using a short-range potential supporting only a few, if any, bound solutions. This means that we will find multiple unbound solutions, corresponding to free particles of various energies. These are basically already eigenstates of the momentum operator, only slightly disturbed by the small potential well at $r=0$. 

Additionally, we want to construct a Berggren basis consisting of complex scattering states, resonances and eventual bound states. Because of the close relation between momentum and energy for scattered states, $E=\frac{k^2}{2m}$, a complex contour in the energy plane will correspond to a complex contour in momentum space.

LAME:
 
We want to rewrite the Schrödinger equation in momentum basis/space, because yada yada.

This essentially means that we describe a state in terms of its momentum distribution, $\Phi(\vec{k})=\braket{\vec{k}}{\psi} $. In the same way that the squared wavefunction $|\psi(\vec{r})|^2$ describes the probability density of a particle to be found at position $\vec{r}$, the squared momentum space wavefunction describes the probability density of a particle to be found with momentum $\vec{k}$. To find the equations of motion in terms of this wavefunction we simply use the completeness of $\ket{\vec{k}}$ to expand the TISE.

\begin{eq}
  H\ket{\psi} &= E\ket{\psi} 
  \\
  \int \rd^3 \vec{k}' \bra{\vec{k}} H \ket{\vec{k}'} \Phi(\vec{k}')
  &= 
  E\Phi(\vec{k})
\end{eq} 

If we consider a central problem, with $H=\frac{k^2}{2m} + V(r)$, a cumbersome calculation, found in Appendix [XXXXX??], shows that the equation can be written
\begin{eq} 
  \frac{k^2}{2m}\phi(k) + \int_0^\infty \rd k' \, k'^2 V(k,k') \phi(k') 
  &=
  E\phi(k)
\end{eq}
where
\begin{eq}
  V(k,k') 
  &= 
  \frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^\infty \rd r \, r^2 V(r) j_l(kr) j_l(k'r) 
\end{eq}
where $j_l(kr)$ are the spherical bessel functions. The total wavefunction can be written $\Phi(\vec{k}) = \phi(k)Y_l^m(\Omega_{\vec{k}})$, where $\Omega_{\vec{k}}$ denotes the angular coordinates of $\vec{k}$.

\subsection{Numerical solution in momentum space}
The equation is solved numerically by writing it as a matrix equation. This is achieved by approximating the integral with a numerical quadrature, 
\begin{eq}
  \int_0^\infty \rd k' \, k'^2 V(k,k')\phi(k') 
  \approx
  \sum_{j=1}^N w_j k_j^2 V(k,k_j)\phi(k_j)
\end{eq}
where $w_j$ are the quadrature weights. For the naive rectangular quadrature you would use a constant $w_j=\Delta k_j$ equal to the step length. However, this quadrature converges slowly to the correct value of the integral, and much better alternatives can be employed. 

With this approximation the Schrödinger equation may be written
\begin{eq}
  \sum_j H_{ij} \phi_j &= E \phi_i
\end{eq}
where $\phi_i=\phi(k_i)$ and 
\begin{eq}
  H_{ij} &= \frac{k_i^2}{2m}\delta_{ij} + w_jk_j^2 V_{ij} \\
  V_{ij} &= \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\infty \rd r \, r^2 V(r) j_l(k_i r) j_l(k_j r)
\end{eq}
The equation is now written as a matrix equation of order N (the number of k values used). The energy eigenvalues $E$ will be obtained by calculating the matrix elements $H_{ij}$ and diagonalizing the resulting matrix. Since there is generally no analytic expression for the terms $V_{ij}$, they will need to be evaluated by numerical integration.
