\begin{abstract}
Resonance is a feature of open, loosely bound quantum systems, such as the atomic nucleus.
We study resonances using as model systems \He{5} and \He{6},\todo{Strange sentence.} treated as an alpha-particle core with one and two valence neutrons respectively.
Basis expansion theory is briefly explained and then used to expand the nuclear system in the harmonic oscillator and plane wave bases.
To find the resonances we extend the plane wave basis into the complex plane, obtaining the so-called Berggren basis. 
With the Berggren basis, we reproduce the known resonances in \He{5} within XXX\%.
\todo[inline]{how many percent? HOW MANY!!?!?!!???????}
The relevant details of the occupation number representation is summarized, and we provide details for its implementation.
The \He{6} problem is then expanded using the \He{5} Berggren basis solutions as a single particle basis. 
For the two-body interaction between the neutrons, we use a gaussian and a Surface Delta Interaction (SDI).
The strength of the interactions is fitted to the \He{6} ground state energy.
With the gaussian interaction we cannot reproduce the \He{6} resonances, whereas with the SDI we can, within XXX\%.
Finally, a Monte Carlo approach to reduce computation time for many-body computations is investigated.
The method is found to be nonsensical and we deem it unusable.

All the computations were implemented in the Python programming language 
using the libraries NumPy and SciPy. 
We used the TikZ and pgfplots libraries to make the figures. 
The code was managed using Git and is available at
