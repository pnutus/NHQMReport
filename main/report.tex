\begin{abstract}
Resonances are important features of open quantum systems.
We study, in particular, loosely bound and unbound nuclear systems.
We model the \He{5} and \He{6} in a few-body picture, consisting of an alpha-particle core with one and two valence neutrons respectively.
Basis-expansion theory is briefly explained and then used to expand the nuclear system in the harmonic oscillator and plane wave bases.
To find the resonances we extend the plane wave basis into the complex momentum plane, obtaining the so-called Berggren basis. 
With the Berggren basis, we reproduce the known resonances in \He{5} well.
The relevant details of the occupation number representation is summarized, and we provide details for its implementation.
The \He{6} system is then expanded using the \He{5} Berggren basis solutions as a single particle basis. 
For the two-body interaction between the neutrons, we use two different phenomenological models: a gaussian and a Surface Delta Interaction (SDI).
The strength of each interaction are fitted to reproduce the \He{6} ground state energy.
With the gaussian interaction we do not obtain the \He{6} resonances, whereas with the SDI we find the observed resonance.
Finally, a Monte-Carlo approach to reduce computation time for many-body systems is investigated.
Our Monte-Carlo implementation is found to be too incorrect to be helpful.

All the computations were implemented in the Python programming language 
using the libraries NumPy and SciPy. 
We used the TikZ and pgfplots libraries to make the figures. 
The code was managed using Git and is available at
